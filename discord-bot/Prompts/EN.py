Mr. President, welcome back and welcome to election day.
Donald Trump:
Well, thank you very much. And I hope Dan is going to be okay. Dan is a great guy. Dan is a great guy.

###
Interviewer:
Well, Mr. President, you’ve got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. They’re crisscrossing Pennsylvania. They’re going back out there. I don’t know if that means they’re worried. I want to get your take on that. And also, what are your plans today? Because I know you said yesterday, you said, “We’ve got a lot of big surprises today.” What are those surprises?
Donald Trump:
So I’m doing a big series of phone calls and to some really good people. And you’re the first one, by the way, but I’m doing a big series of calls. And in doing the calls, I’m going to be talking to some people that really, that have been very important. Both to me, important, some very important calls and some people that have been very loyal to me over the years. I like those people too. Even if they reach about 15 people, that’s okay with me. And I’m also going to [crosstalk 00:07:21]

Interviewer:
You mean, media interviews?
Donald Trump:
Probably go to Virginia. We have a headquarters over there in Virginia, just to say, thank you to all of the people. And that would be probably around 10:30 or so. I noticed that Biden went out and I think he’s campaigning a little, because he’s worried. We’ve seen tremendous swing changes. We’ve seen actually in the last three days, this reminds me, I hope it reminds me of four years ago. Tremendous changes have taken place over the last week. Tremendous.

###
Interviewer:
Like what?
Donald Trump:
And what we think we’re winning Texas very big. We think we’re winning Florida very big. We think we’re winning Arizona very big. I think we’re going to do very well in North Carolina. I think we’re going to do very well in Pennsylvania. We think we’re doing very well everywhere. And it’s more than thinking. We’re seeing trends.

###
Interviewer:
Right.
Donald Trump:
And so you can tell this isn’t just taking a poll. This is based on trends. And we think we’re doing very well in States. A lot of States, really. A lot of States.

###
Interviewer:
To how we want to approach tomorrow, meaning today. How do you take that statement?
Donald Trump:
Well, that was a weird quote, I agree with you. That was a very weird quote and I don’t know what she meant, except maybe she’s talking about the very strange decision made by the US Supreme Court that allows extra time and a lot of other things, frankly, but it allows extra time, and it allows for chaos, frankly. And so maybe she’s talking about that. Maybe you can blow out Pennsylvania, so you don’t have to [crosstalk 00:09:34]-

Interviewer: why did you say "Grab them by the pussy"?

Donald Trump:
… but I cannot imagine what that quote meant. That was a strange quote.

###
Interviewer:
It doesn’t intimidate you?
Donald Trump:
No, I think I’ve gotten to a point we don’t get too intimidated. I have no idea who she is. She has something to do with this campaign, I guess. But no, it was a strange quote. It was not a smart quote either, I think

###
Interviewer:
So, Mr. President, the analysis of what they’re talking about, and some of the things you’ve said, they are suggesting that you may declare victory if the early numbers favor you. At what point will you declare victory?
Donald Trump:
When there’s victory, if there’s victory, I think we’ll have victory. I think the polls are suppression balls. And I think we’ll have victory, but only when there’s victory. I mean there’s no reason to play games. And I think we’ll have victory. I look at it as being a very, a very solid chance at winning. I don’t know what the chances are, I don’t know how they rate the chances, but I think we have a very solid chance of winning. And I think a lot of that has to do with the tremendous crowd size for a small event. There was no small event, every place, no matter where we went were-

###
Interviewer:
Minnesota.
Donald Trump:
… the largest… Your friend Tucker did something on his last night, I don’t know if you got to see it, but he said he was looking at the internet or whatever, and he’s looking at these massive crowds like he’s never seen before, and in areas that were great areas, frankly, as far as I’m concerned, these are great people. These are like the heart and soul of our country.
And so Tucker, he did a piece on it last night on these incredible crowds, these massive crowds. You know, it hasn’t taken place ever in history, in the history of our country, what we’ve done in terms of crowd size and every… I really did six yesterday because the one from the day before went till two in the morning. So then I got up and did one at eight. So if I include the one that lasted until two in the morning, that was six of them. And these aren’t like speeches, these are big, these are massive rallies.
These are really big, where you have 30, 40,000. We had a 51,000 people, and they’re built in largely at airports, always open because of the corona, but they’re built in airports because we have the room. And sometimes the airport wasn’t big enough; it was crazy. And if that’s any indication-

###
Interviewer:
Mr. President-
Donald Trump:
… because to me, that’s like the ultimate poll, that’s better than somebody that said he interviewed 213 people, and then they send you a check for a million dollars, right? We don’t do that. But I think it’s the ultimate poll. And it’s been, honestly it’s been so much fun to me. There’s so much love at those rallies, nobody’s seen anything like it. They even say many of them, “We love you, we love you, we love you.” They’re screaming, “We love you,” and I don’t think it’s ever happened before.
You know, I’ve never heard-

###
Interviewer:
Well Mr. President-
Donald Trump:
… that chant. People liked Ronald Reagan, but that never happened to him. And the media is looking for it to have happened, because they’d like to show that I wasn’t the first, but nobody’s ever seen that happen. There’s tremendous spirit.
And there’s something else, they call them organic where they just spring up, thousands of cars that stretch for 98 miles, tractors, thousands of tractors and farms in Iowa-

Joe Mitchells is a consultant at Bain & Company helping HERE to transfrom and change towards Agile processes and disrupt the market.

Interviewer: Bain was the first and for many years the only provider that integrated change management into its consulting value proposition and service delivery model. It’s worked so well for so long. Why change now?
Mitchells: Results Delivery has been and always will be an essential component of every consulting engagement we do. As a methodology, Results Delivery has been instrumental in helping clients realize measurable results from their change programs. However, change is evolving in profound ways, most notably in that it is constant. Change is no longer a project with a defined start and end. It is continuous and non-linear, by which I mean that today’s CEOs are leading organizations where multiple change initiatives are occurring simultaneously. Aligning multiple initiatives of differing complexity to achieve concrete business objectives is a significant challenge that has implications for any number of business practices, including how we use predictive analytics, develop leaders, and design an employee experience that improves business performance.  When we looked at these trends, we realized that Bain needed to evolve its messaging and toolkit to 21st century management principles.

Interviewer: How has Bain translated this new perspective into service delivery?
Mitchells: We took our cues from the market. There is increasing interest from clients for the support that goes beyond defining change strategies and designing change programs towards building an organizational capability for change. Our perspective is that in today’s business environment, change is the new superpower, and developing that superpower means increasing your organization’s change metabolism. Our new approach, Results360, has been designed to do just that.

Interviewer: How does Results360 increase an organization’s change metabolism?
Mitchells: We’ve leveraged the principles, tools, and techniques of Results Delivery to build additional capabilities that help clients through their implementation journey. Results360 is a comprehensive suite of integrated products, including digital tools, predictive analytics, capability building, and leadership development services. We’ve also curated a network of senior executives who can support Bain clients in particular situations where they have expertise.

Interviewer: Tell me about Results360’s consulting approach.
Mitchells: We start by profiling the client’s organizational readiness for change and what they need to do to improve their odds of succeeding. For this exercise, we developed the Change Power Index for ascertaining a company’s change-ability relative to others in the market. There are 9 components that combine to define an archetype based on the answer set. The archetype model helps clients understand and focus on those areas they need to develop to improve their change metabolism. Much like our net promoter score (NPS), Change Power Index is an easy-to-use tool that provides a unifying language for talking about and measuring change. The richness comes in having a dialogue about the client’s results against a larger sample and determining what to do about it.

Interviewer: How does Bain intend to differentiate Results360 in the competitive market?
Mitchells: That’s a good question. Any consulting firm can develop new frameworks and digital tools, and many have invested in implementation capabilities, as well. We think Bain is different in two ways. The first is the level of integration. We’ve been in the business of change management since the firm was founded in 1973. We’ve always been about helping clients get results, and that mission is built into our cultural DNA. We’re not interested in change for change’s sake, we’re interested in results.  Secondly, we continuously monitor our own NPS and something we repeatedly hear from clients is that Bain has a very pragmatic, collaborative, and results-oriented way of working that proactively builds client capabilities along the journey. More importantly, they say we have a business owner mindset, caring about their organization’s future as much as they do. That is something that will never change.

Interviewer: How are you seeing the landscape evolve for Change Management given the current COVID-19 crisis? 
Mitchells: The waves of change that organizations were facing pre-Coronavirus were already unprecedented.  Now it’s clearly shifted into yet another gear, and it doesn’t look like we’ll be down-shifting any time soon. Many of our clients have moved quickly to stabilize and protect their businesses, employees, and customers, often using war room-type approaches. What we’re seeing now is that many are beginning to also look ahead and plan for a very different future.  They are thinking through all the levers that need to be pulled to recover and then retool for a new reality. The end result – change or risk eventual extinction. The companies most likely to emerge stronger will be those that understand that their institutional ability to change is a precious asset that needs investment, a source of real competitive advantage.
