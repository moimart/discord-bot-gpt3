# Discord GPT-3 Bot ++
This bot communicates with OpenAI API to provide users with Q&A, completion, sentiment analysis, emojification and various other functions. 
It is based on [Discord GPT-3 Bot](https://github.com/e4c6/DiscordGPT-3)

Main features:
* Q&A as (all these personalities might not be politically correct but they are just for fun (and also to show how dangerous GPT-3 can be impersonating groups). These do not represent my views or way of thinking in any way whatsoever.):
    * normal
    * Trump the politician
    * Trump the sexist guy
    * A pedantic guy
    * A Qanon follower
    * Other personalities
* Completion
* Generation
* Emojification
* Sentiment Analysis
* Sarcastic Q&A
* Foulmouth Q&A
* Song Generation (lyrics)
* Headline Generation

You will need your own .env file (check .env.example) and you can start it with docker-compose on the gpt3bot folder. 

You will also need to setup the Discord Bot yourself.

And of course, you need a GPT-3 beta API key to get to use this bot. See [here](https://beta.openai.com/) for details.
